# Thesis
> A [Bespoke.js](http://markdalgleish.com/projects/bespoke.js) presentation, built with [generator-bespoke](https://github.com/markdalgleish/generator-bespoke).

<hr/>
> <i>I hereby replaced the <code>prism</code> dependency from the <code>generator-bespoke</code>, with a new one created from <a href="http://prismjs.com/download.html" target="_blank">here</a>, which extends the basic language support.
But, maybe there's a <a href="https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/issues/768" target="_blank">better way</a> to get the job done.</i>
